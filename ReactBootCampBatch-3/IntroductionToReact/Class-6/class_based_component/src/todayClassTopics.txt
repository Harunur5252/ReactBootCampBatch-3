1. Class based component
2. Compare class based component with functional component
3. Image import(card)

## we can use Image in react some way
1. from public folder 
example : <img src='/logo192.png'  alt='logo'/> 
2.from src folder and in this case we have to import according to css.That's means If we want to set dynamically Image then use this format.
example : 
    import reactLogo from '../Images/logo512.png'
    <img src={reactLogo}  alt='logo'/>
