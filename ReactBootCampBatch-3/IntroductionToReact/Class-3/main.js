// for react set up required :
// 1) combine multiple files - webpack,parcel(call module bandelar)
// 2) processing next generation javaScript(jsx,es6 to next version) - babel
// 3) code quality check - eslint
// But webpack can works with above all.
// create react-app is a package that makes a boiler plate for works and including webpack,babel,eslint and others.

// difference between npm and npx :

/* 
 npm is node package manager. we can install any third party package by npm and npx both.
 But npx has an extra benefit. we can directly install any package by npx.
 Example :  npx create-react-app my-app.
 similar package we can install by npm.But at first we will install create-react-app this package.
 then create-react-app my-app(which name do you give your project).

// React philosophy
/*
  1) composition : to combine functions to one for more complexity.
  2) declarative code : each part is not tell.that's clean code.
  3) unidirectional data flow : parent to child data pass.if needed to change data in child then change parent
  4) React is JavaScript : whole react is used core js.
